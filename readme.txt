= Usage =

**Shortcode**

To display the content upgrades archive, insert the [content_upgreades_archive] shortcode into the editor of any post or page.


== Notes ==

The content upgrades archive currently uses the upgrades Popup title, content, and button text by default. As the parent Content Upgrades plugin improves, we'll provide better customization settings for these areas.

= Customization =

To customize the output of the content upgrades archive content, you can copy the contents of the `templates/shortcodes/archive.php` file from the plugin files and add them to your theme here: `content-upgrades/shortcodes/archive.php`.
